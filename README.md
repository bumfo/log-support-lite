# Log Support Lite Plugin

This is an IntelliJ IDEA plugin. <https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/8463>

Clone core features from "Log Support" which is not maintained for a long time.

Optimized only for SLF4J.

- Support live templates: logt, logd, logi, logw, loge. </li>
- Support inspection that detects mismatched argument count for log message format,
    and the last throwable argument is excluded now. :)
- Add quick fix to add placeholder.

PS: Support 'sqlp' to create a MapSqlParameterSource with all parameter filled.
